I Started the exam project on 3 August 2022 ( i literally didn't notice an email was received to me on 2 August).
Its my first time create project using Laravel framework, so for the reference and case study i watch
"Belajar Laravel" on Web Programming Unpas youtube channel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqAMb6kqlLs&list=PLFIM0718LjIWiihbBIq-SWPU6b6x21Q_2

Installation and reqruitments :
PHP 8.1.2
Laravel 9.23.0
Valet packagist = https://packagist.org/packages/cretueusebiu/valet-windows

How to open the file : 
to open localhost use localhost:8080
web url = exam.test
because i use valet packagist so there's any reqruitment for open the webview (as far as i know because i never opened it on other computer)
IP4 dns must be 127.0.0.1
IP 6 = ::1



i create the project based on the playlist of those youtube video :
STEP 1 : Learn about laravel,folder, route and view
- First Step i learn to install & configure laravel framework & Valet packagist using github.
- I make all 3 pages webview,navbar and try to using blade templating engine

STEP 2 : create the database
- After watching how to create model,controller and learn about Eloquent Relationship. i try to create database.its really make me stuck for such like 2 day
because i find it difficult to learn about eloquent relationship. then i skipped that and make a rough database using factory & seeder. 
- then i continued to revised the route,webview,controller and models.

STEP 3 : Sync the Database & Webview wireframe 
- I've trying so hard to make Eloquent relationship running so actually i'm not knowing enough about that and i'm force
myself to using all the source code i find on stack overflow,youtube even random website as far as the website can running so i can finished the project.

- Next step before i submit my project. i'm revising all my coding to make it simpler and easier to checked.


For the last I'm apologize if there any incorrect method or wrong result of my project.
